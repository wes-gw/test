# Goal

The goal of this project is to build a data platform which will enable Glasswing Ventures (“Glasswing”) to store, manage, and use a variety of proprietary information (“content”) in support of a broad range of investing and management decisions. The platform will assist Glasswing on multiple facets, including fundraising, portfolio support (both with recruiting talent and customers) & monitoring, deal sourcing, screening & diligence, as well as marketing and raising brand awareness. 

# Stakeholders
The platform requirements have been gathered from the following users:
* Glasswing Managing Partners (also representing portfolio company executives)
* The investment and analyst team
* The marketing and operations team
* The data analytics team


# Platform contents
The platform is a data hub populated with a myriad of information about people, companies Glasswing is not associated with, and companies that exist or may potential exist in Glasswing’s portfolio.
