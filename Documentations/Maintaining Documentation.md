# Overview
The documentation in this repository serves as the central knowledge base, written in Markdown format. The [README.md](http://readme.md/) file is the home page of all documentations, containing links referencing individual sections. All sections exist in the Documentations folder. To edit a page, click the pencil icon on the right corner. Press the "commit changes" button at the bottom to save any changes. For each commit, we label and describe the changes. We can also make edits from our local repo and commit through terminal, similar to pushing our code. Github automatically tracks revision history. Labeling and commenting our changes provide a clear process for tracking history.

## Versioning

# Database
A proposed system for versioning and updating the schema involves creating a feedback time-period before each new version. Changing the schema will become an involved process of updating scripts, front-ends, testing and version-control. Due to this breaking up the lifecycle of the database into n-month periods in which feedback from all stakeholders on updating schema (adding and deleting columns, adding tables, changing data types, etc.) is compiled. Once the nth month is hit, all the proposed feedback is implemented and a new version is rolled out. At which that time new ddl files and a new UML diagram are updated as well and the next period of n months starts.This avoids a tiresome process of allowing schema to change on request as well as staying organized with a shorter timestamped history of versioned schemas.
