# Overview
The documentation in this repository serves as the central knowledge base, written in Markdown format. The [README.md](http://readme.md/) file is the home page of all documentations, containing links referencing individual sections. All sections exist in the Documentations folder. To edit a page, click the pencil icon on the right corner. Press the "commit changes" button at the bottom to save any changes. For each commit, we label and describe the changes. We can also make edits from our local repo and commit through terminal, similar to pushing our code. Github automatically tracks revision history. Labeling and commenting our changes provide a clear process for tracking history.
